# Dimensions

S88-light is structured along five dimensions:

| # | Dimension | Description |
|---|---|---|
| **[1]** | [Operations](1_operations/) | Unit operations — the atomic actions in a recipe |
| **[2]** | [Sequence](2_sequence/) | Workflow, recipe structure, and orchestration |
| **[3]** | [Events](3_events/) | Time series, observations, and recorded data |
| **[4]** | [Devices](4_devices/) | Hardware declarations (optional) |
| **[5]** | [Materials](5_materials/) | Chemical and ingredient declarations |

This taxonomy follows the [wiki](https://github.com/Gressling/S88-light/wiki) and reflects the ISA-88 separation of procedural, equipment, and material concerns.
